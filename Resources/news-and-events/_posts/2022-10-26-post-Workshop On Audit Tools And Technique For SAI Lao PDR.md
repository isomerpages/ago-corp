From 26 to 28 October 2022, AGO hosted a virtual workshop on “Audit Technique and Tools” for the auditors from the State Audit Organization of Lao PDR (Lao SAO).

The workshop began with an Opening Ceremony where Singapore Ambassador to Lao PDR Ms Leow Siu Lin, Deputy Auditor-General Rina Chua and Lao SAO Vice President, H.E. Mr Bounleuth Thepvongsa each gave their opening remarks.

During the workshop, AGO officials shared on multiple topics – an overview of AGO, the types of audit we do, our audit and risk frameworks, the AGO audit process,  AGO’s training model, digital tools that AGO used for auditing, and  procurement and contracts audits of construction projects .

On the last day, Auditor-General (AG) Goh Soon Poh chaired a panel discussion, during which participants asked questions on various topics such as the process of reporting AGO’s observations to Parliament and how AGO follows up on its observations.
