<p>As part of AGO's outreach efforts, AGO conducts guest lectures at NUS
for Accountancy undergraduates. For the most recent session in Oct 2023,
Deputy Auditor-General Rina spoke about AGO’s work and shared interesting
audit observations. In addition, AGO officers introduced participants to
our ‘tools of the trade’, including the use of data analytics and robotic
process automation, which was met with enthusiastic response. The students
took the opportunity to find out more about life as an AGO auditor, other
career-related information (e.g., work culture, progression) and also enquired
on current job opportunities in AGO.</p>
