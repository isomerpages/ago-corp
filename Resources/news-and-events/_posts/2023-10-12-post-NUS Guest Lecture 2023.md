As part of AGO’s outreach efforts, AGO conducts guest lectures at NUS for Accountancy undergraduates. For the most recent session in Oct 2023, Deputy Auditor-General Rina Chua spoke about AGO’s work and shared interesting audit observations. In addition, AGO officers introduced participants to our ‘tools of the trade’, including the use of data analytics and robotic process automation, which was met with enthusiastic response. The students took the opportunity to find out more about life as an AGO auditor, other career-related information (e.g., work culture, progression) and also enquired on current job opportunities in AGO.
