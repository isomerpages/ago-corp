*DAG Rina Chua explaining government audits to undergraduates*

AGO continuously explores different platforms to reach out to university students. In Jan 2024, Deputy Auditor-General Rina Chua conducted a guest lecture at SMU and introduced Accountancy undergraduates to AGO and our role in public accountability. It was an eye-opening experience for participants who had the opportunity to better understand the principles of Government procurement and learn about interesting audit observations. The feedback was positive, with one of the highlights being the candid interaction with AGO officers who shared on why they chose national auditing as their profession.
