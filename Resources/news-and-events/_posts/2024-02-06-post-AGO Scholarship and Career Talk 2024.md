<p>The AGO Scholarship and Career Talk 2024 was held on 6 February 2024 in
AGO HQ. We hosted students from the universities and pre-tertiary institutions
who were interested to fund out more about AGO, our work and the types
of scholarships we offer. The event started off with AGâ€™s opening remarks,
followed by a sharing about AGO and an interesting audit finding by our
officer. The students were also kept informed of the scholarship and career
opportunities in AGO by the Director of Corporate Development. The event
concluded with a panel-sharing segment where students get their queries
answered. It was definitely an informative and fulfilling session.</p>
