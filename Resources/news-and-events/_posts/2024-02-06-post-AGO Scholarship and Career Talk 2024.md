The AGO Scholarship and Career Talk 2024 was held on 6 February 2024 in AGO HQ. We hosted students from the universities and pre-tertiary institutions who were interested to fund out more about AGO, our work and the types of scholarships we offer. The event started off with AGâ€™s opening remarks, followed by a sharing about AGO and an interesting audit finding by our officer. The students were also kept informed of the scholarship and career opportunities in AGO by the Director of Corporate Development. The event concluded with a panel-sharing segment where students get their queries answered. It was definitely an informative and fulfilling session.
