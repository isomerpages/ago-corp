<p>As part of AGO’s continuous outreach efforts to engage our youth, Deputy
Auditor-General Rina Chua delivered a guest lecture at NUS for Business
and Accountancy students in April 2024. She shared with the undergraduates
an overview of AGO’s work as the national auditor and AGO’s role in enhancing
public accountability. DAG presented a selection of past AGO audit observations,
illustrating the importance of the key principles of Government procurement.
Assistant Director John Tay also took the opportunity to introduce some
of the digital tools that AGO used in recent audits. Through the real-world
examples and Q&amp;A session, the students gained a deeper understanding
of what the life of an AGO auditor is like.</p>
