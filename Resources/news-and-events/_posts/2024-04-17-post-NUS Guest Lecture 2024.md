<p>As part of AGO’s continuous efforts to engage key stakeholders including
university students, Deputy Auditor-General Rina Chua conducted a guest
lecture at NUS for Business and Accountancy students in Apr 2024. She shared
AGO’s as the national auditor, as well as the principles of Government
procurement and eye-opening audit observations. Assistant Director John
Tay also took the opportunity to introduce some of the digital tools that
AGO used in last year's Thematic Audit of Singapore Tourism Board.
<br>
<br>It was overall a lively session with constant interaction between AGO
officers and students, finally cumulating in some of the graduating students
indicating interest in joining the company.</p>
