<p>On 9 December 2024, a research team from the Board of Audit and Inspection
(BAI) of Korea visited AGO. The delegation was led by Mr Cha Kyung-yup,
Director of Research Team for Digital Sector Audit. He was accompanied
by research fellows Ms Kim Hye Rim and Ms Park Eun Seo.</p>
<p>After a warm welcome from Director Paul Loke, an AGO representative shared
on AGO’s Digital Transformation journey. Ms Park then shared on the BARON
System, which helps to streamline audits by collecting, sorting and analysing
digital data, and its use cases. Ms Kim subsequently shared on BAI’s AI-based
audit approach. This included the use of image analysis and natural language
processing technologies to detect illegal activities and suspicious projects
respectively.</p>
<p>Before concluding the meeting, the two SAIs engaged in a meaningful discussion
on the challenges faced in the use of cloud-based technologies and LLMs.</p>
