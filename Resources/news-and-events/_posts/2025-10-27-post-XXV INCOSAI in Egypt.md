<p>Auditor-General Ng Wai Choong led a delegation to attend the 25th (XXV)
International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions (INCOSAI) held in
Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from 27 to 31 October 2025. The triennial Congress
was hosted and chaired by the Accountability State Authority of Egypt,
which would assume chairmanship of the International Organisation of the
Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) for a three-year period from 2025
to 2028. The event was attended by approximately 200 SAIs.</p>
<p>The 25th INCOSAI discussions centred on these themes: “The Role of Supreme
Audit Institutions in Auditing Central Banks and Government Activities
during Financial and Economic Crises” and “Using Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Techniques in Auditing”. Discussions included recommendations for
strengthening audit oversight in crisis contexts and how SAIs could utilise
AI tools in audits, as well as approaches to auditing auditees’ use of
AI tools in their work processes. AGO also had the opportunity to share
insights from our audits during breakout sessions.</p>
<p>AGO also took the opportunity to meet with international counterparts
on the sidelines of the Congress. AG separately met with Mr Gareth Davies,
Comptroller &amp; Auditor-General (C&amp;AG) of the United Kingdom National
Audit Office (UK NAO), and Dr Carelee McLiesh, Auditor-General of the Australian
National Audit Office (ANAO).</p>
