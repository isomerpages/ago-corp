<p>SAI Singapore was one of the participants of the DCM</p>
<h4>8th ASEANSAI Summit</h4>
<p>The Summit took place on 13 November 2025, marking a significant milestone
as the first time SAI Singapore served as host for this key biennial ASEANSAI
event.</p>
<p>The event welcomed 81 delegates from 15 countries. Beyond representatives
from all 10 ASEANSAI members, the Summit was attended by partner SAIs/organisations
from Canada, China, Sweden, and Switzerland. Following Timor-Leste’s historic
admission into ASEAN at the 47th ASEAN Summit in Malaysia, SAI Singapore
and the other ASEANSAI members were honoured to have SAI Timor-Leste joining
the Summit.</p>
<p>Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second
Minister for Finance and National Development, delivered the opening address
as Guest of Honour. Highlighting that SAI Singapore assuming the chairmanship
of ASEANSAI for the first time was a particularly meaningful milestone
as it coincided with Singapore’s 60th year of independence, Ms Indranee
also said that ASEANSAI goes beyond being an arena for professional engagement
to reflecting the shared commitment among ASEAN member states to regional
co-operation, good governance, and growth.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was enriched by a musical performance from the Xinmin
Nightingales from Xinmin Primary School, which provided an engaging start
to the proceedings.</p>
<p>During the Summit, SAI Singapore formally transitioned from its role as
ASEANSAI Vice Chair (2023-2025) to assume Chairmanship for the 2025-2027
term, while SAI Thailand took over as Vice Chair. Key approvals included
the ASEANSAI Annual Results Report 2025 covering Committees and Secretariat
activities, the ASEANSAI Strategic Plan 2026-2029 and appointment of Chairmanship
of the various Committees.</p>

<p>The 8th ASEANSAI Summit concluded successfully</p>
<h4>Young Leaders’ Programme (YLP)</h4>
<p>The inaugural YLP was held concurrently with the Summit, bringing together
young public officials from across ASEANSAI member organisations. Under
the theme "Building for the Future", participants shared insights on recent
innovations in public sector auditing and discussed current priorities
within their respective SAIs. The programme created a valuable platform
for cross-regional learning and contributed to participants' professional
development whilst enhancing understanding of regional audit practices.</p>
