To ensure quality in our audits, AGO has implemented a Quality Assurance Framework (QAF). The QAF comprises systems, structures, policies and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the audits done by AGO meet recognised professional standards. The QAF also includes the AGO Code of Conduct and Ethics (Code), which all AGO auditors must abide by. 

In developing the Code, AGO took into consideration the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions Code of Ethics and relevant ethical requirements in the ACRA Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities.  It presents ethical principles to be followed by all AGO auditors in conducting audits and provides additional guidance to supplement the Governmentâ€™s Code of Conduct for civil servants.
